            I am <strong>Daniel Nonso Chukwurah</strong>, A Front-end Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. I help brands and organistions
            build scalable web applications and softwares that are user friendly, accesible, usuable and meet their
            goals using technology.

          I'm currently a Front-end Engineer at Sidmach Technologies Limited building enterprise web solutions and
          softwares together with amazing teams for amazing clients.

          I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design - combining state-of-the-art
          technical knowledge with a keen eye for design to create a most beautiful product and services. My goal is to
          always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging user
          experience.

           As a Front-end Engineer, I'm passionate about building softwares that are accessible, have good user experience, good designs,
          and test driven.


          When I'm not coding you can find me surfing the internet, playing and watching football, playing video games, farming (Yeah! you heard that) or hanging out with friends and family.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>writing clean codes to the best of my ability. I also enjoy learning new technologies.</p> -->

        My name is Nenne Adaora Nwodo. I fondly like to be called Adora. I am a Software Engineer based in Lagos,
        Nigeria who loves mobile experiences and artificial intelligence.

        I currently work as a Software Engineer at the Microsoft Cognition team & I have a Bachelor of Science (First
        class) in Computer Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria.

        In October 2018, I created a blog called AdoraHack, where I post software development articles or any tech thing
        I find interesting. In June 2019, I took AdoraHack to YouTube. On the YouTube channel, I post tutorials and
        other tech content that could be useful to software developers.

        My non-tech passion includes education & music. I believe everyone should be given a chance at basic education.

        In tech, I am a huge fan of great mobile experiences driven by AI. At a tech event, you'd probably find me in a
        booth with a VR headset on, or trying to play a game (and possibly failing at it).

        I am also passionate about the developer community and I am trying to drive inclusion for more women in tech.
        Because of this, I co-organize some developer events (e.g. GDG Ajah, FSD Lagos, Android Nigeria), I speak at
        some events as well & I mentor developers through ALC or any other platform that lets me do so.
